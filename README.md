Welcome USER_NAME,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!


Hurton Fitness 2.0

python3 -m http.server

Welcome to the README.md file for the Hurton Fitness website. I am building a static front-end website for an individual using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The individual is a professional fitness instructor and swimming teacher. The main purpose of the website is to promote the Hurton Fitness brand in the interest of attracting new clients and retaining existing clients. It will be accessed by existing clients, potential clients and others wanting to learn more about Iain Hurton's lifestyle and his overall approach to fitness. The website will include different navigation pages for contact information, a gallery and upcoming events respectively.

The header will include the clickable logo 'Hurton Fitness' which will allow you to return to the Homepage. The Nav Bar will have links to each of the other three pages: "Contact", "Events" & "Gallery".

The "Contact" page will include contact information for the fitness instructor such as name and email address. It will also include a form which can be used to register interest in upcoming events or to get in touch with the trainer.

The "Events" page will include details of upcoming events such as bootcamps, group fitness sessions and swimming classes. it will also promote the availability of 1:1 Personal Training classes.

The "Gallery" page will include pictures of the trainer taking part in fitness events or races. It will also include pictures from a clothing line photoshoot. Additionally, there will also be different versions of the brand logo.

The footer will include links to the trainer's profile on social media platforms such as Facebook, Spotify and Instagram. It will also include a mailto: link for his email address and a link to download a PDF copy of the trainer's qualifications and references.

Motivation
When I started preparing for my first milestone project, I wanted to choose an individual or organisation that would benefit greatly from having a website or online presence. My first project idea was about my local football club which I would have enjoyed creating and designing. However, my football club already has a functioning website and so, I decided to turn my attention elsewhere.

I decided on designing a website for an individual who is a professional fitness instructor and swimming teacher. Iain Hurton is a long-time family friend who found a passion for health and fitness after finishing secondary school. Iain is now a fully qualified fitness instructor, personal trainer, swimming teacher and lifeguard. In recent years, I have been amazed and inspired by Iain’s work ethic and willingness to grow his fitness brand. Although I have not yet taken part, I have witnessed his group fitness classes in which he is very friendly, motivating and encouraging. Iain has shown his ability to adapt to unexpected situations. In recent months, Iain was forced to pivot to online classes while lockdown measures prevent groups from forming in large numbers and put a halt to swimming classes for the foreseeable future.

I chose to create a website specifically for Iain after following his progress for a number of years. It was clear that he would gain some benefit from having an online presence other than social media platforms. Iain has already generated a strong following on social media platforms particularly Instagram and Facebook. He has gained a promising client base with men and women ranging from teenagers to retired people. For this reason, I thought he would greatly benefit from having a website which could be accessed by existing clients, potential clients and others wanting to learn more about Iain Hurton's lifestyle and his overall approach to fitness.

Challenges
One challenge I experienced when creating this website was meeting up with others in the hope of getting their valuable opinions and feedback on my progress. One solution to this was to schedule a video call on Microsoft Teams with my friends and colleagues. I was able to share my screen, navigate throughout the website and show off some features while describing my actions. As part of my testing process, I have shared my progress with family members, friends and colleagues. This process was beneficial and highly valuable for user experience, asking questions and implementing feedback. This was very helpful in the designing and structuring of my website.

Another setback I had was scheduling my first mentoring session. I scheduled the session for a Wednesday evening but lost track of time and ended up missing the appointment. This was completely my fault and so I could not reschedule for a future date. I was determined to invest sufficient time and effort into this project to achieve a desirable grade but more importantly to reach the goal I set out with. That goal was to design a static front-end website which I can look back on with pride. I experienced frustration at times during this project but ultimately, I learned a vast amount about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap through making mistakes and correcting them.

Design
Colour Scheme #7AE7C7 #75BBA7 #FFEEAD #4C5C68 #1985A1

Typography

The 'Fjalla One', sans-serif font is the primary font used throughout the website. From the Google Fonts website: Fjalla One is a medium contrast display sans serif. Fjalla One has been carefully adjusted to the restrictions of the screen. Despite having display characteristics Fjalla One can be used in a wide range of sizes.

'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive is the font used for H1 Headings throughout the website. From the Google Fonts website: Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the Chicago Design System, as well as the citizens of Chicago. The family's tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago's multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance.

Big Shoulders, the primary family, is used in the Chicago Design System as the primary typeface to identify Chicago and its citizens. Big Shoulders allows Chicagoans to speak with one consistent typographic voice. Big Shoulders Stencil explores Chicago’s histories in work and protest, and is designed to apply the Chicagoan voice to those uses. I like the font at first glance and I loved discovering its roots in Chicago as we share that connection.

Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, full-width background images on each page were chosen to be striking, vibrant and to grab the user's attention right away. The website has a modern, vigorous and vibrant appeal and will peak the interest of the user at first sight.
Wireframes
I used the website wireframe.cc to create blueprints for my website. I also sketched some wireframes and blueprints by hand. I created wireframes for all pages on the websites. All wireframes and mockups can be found in the folder assets/documentation.
